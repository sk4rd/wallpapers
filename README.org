This is my wallpaper repository, featuring lots of different themes
and art styles. You can find all of the wallpapers in 4K
(3840x2160). I have also provided a shell script, which enables you to
resize the images to your preferred resolution.

Below are links to the directories containing my wallpapers,
categorized by theme.
